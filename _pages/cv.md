Education
=========

* B.E. in Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, 2021-2025

Experience
==========

* Intern, MSR AI for Science June 2024 - December 2024
  - Improve the Ewald MP method to make it equivariant and fix problems in the original code
  - Test in different molecular systems to explore the role of long-range modules
* Partcipant of Academic Rising Stars Program, Tsinghua University July 2023 - Oct 2023
  - Multi-task learning of proteins based on heterogeneous graphs
  - Finding datasets about proteins and adding researched datasets to new datasets allows the model to complete multi-task learning
  - Run the single-task experiment and compare the results of the single-task experiment with the multi-task experiment
* Rising Stars Program “Basic Models” Special Project, Tsinghua University July 2023 - Aug 2023
  - Lecture + Hackathon
  - Gained a basic understanding of large language models
  - Understood the LLM architecture and the application of large models in other tasks (multimodal model, protein language model). Had experience of finetuning
* Partcipant of Academic Rising Stars Program, Tsinghua University Nov 2022 - May 2022
