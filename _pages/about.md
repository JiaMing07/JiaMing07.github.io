Welcome to my homepage! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology and minoring in Statistics. My current interest is focused on AI for Science, including biology and physics. I hope to be able to solve practical scientific problems through rapidly developed computer technology.
