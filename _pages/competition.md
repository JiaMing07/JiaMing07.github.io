I got the **winning prize** in "XinDong Project" technology winter camp. This is a competition designed for first-year undergraduates with no prior background. Our group designed an intelligent vehicle that equipped with a Lane Keeping System, Parking Assistance System, Traffic Light Recognition System, and a Forward Collision Warning System.
