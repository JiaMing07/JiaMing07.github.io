# AI for Physics & Chemistry

- Design experiments to benchmark and assess SOTA and commonly used MLFF (machine learning force field)
  architectures, including MACE, QuinNet.
- Explore the importances of LR in different molecular systems using both ML driven and physics driven analyses.

# AI for Biology

- Leveraging multi-task learning for protein function prediction via heterogeneous graphs
- Integration of diverse protein datasets to enhance multi-task learning capabilities, enriching the model with
  additional research data
- Conducting single-task experiments and comparing their results with those of the multi-task learning approach

# Medical Image segmentation

- Segmentation of bone rings in CT images using traditional image segmentation methods and neural network
  methods
